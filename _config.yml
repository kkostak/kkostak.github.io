  Hi! My name is Katie and I'm a current junior at Tufts University studying Mechanical Engineering! My name is Katie Kostak, and I'm a current junior at Tufts University studying Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science. Originally from New Jersey, I was drawn to Tufts for the dual degree SMFA program, but instead fell in love with engineering. Iâ€™m a firm believer that engineering is inherently artistic and creative, and love to express myself through the various projects I take on!
