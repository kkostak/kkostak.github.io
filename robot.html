							<h3>Part 1: Driving Up A Ramp</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/robot/demo.gif" alt="" /></span>This was a project for Tufts' ME30: Electronics and Controls. We were first tasked to design from scratch a robot that can drive up a ramp. For this, we laser-cut the frame out of acrylic, and 3D printed the hardware and motor mounts. We did run into issues of the motor mounts deflecting under the weight of the robot, which would cause the motors to hit the ground at an angle and make it really difficuly to drive straight. However, this issue was solved using a little bit of cardboard wedged between the mount and the frame :). But, just to leave no room for error, we decided to add laser-cut barriers to the side of the robot to make sure it couldn't fall off. While testing, we ran into the issue of the robot slipping, to which we added [     ] to the wheels to provide traction, and increased weight at the center of mass and it went up the ramp beautifully!  </p>
							<h3>Part 2: Communicating Over Wifi</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" alt="" /></span>The second part of this project was to have our robot collaborate with any other partner robot from the class to together push a tube up two parallel ramps. As a former CS major (for only a year), I thought that the coding part of the project would be totally in my wheelhouse. Let it be known that I have never written python code before - let alone python code with wifi capabilities. Needless to say this was a stretch of my former CS capabilities. But for this project, I learned how to implement a client-server model by having my computer host a HTML webpage with the robot's start button. When you press that button, it will send a request to the Raspberry Pi on the robot. The robot then sends a request to the partner robot saying "Hey I want to go at This Speed!" and waits for either a reply of "Yes Lets go That Speed!" or "Actually I want to go This Other Speed" in which case it will just agree and go. Then, while driving, our robot uses buttons placed at the forefront (by the side barriers) to gague whether or not the beam was at an angle, which would mean the robots are going different speeds. In this case, we would speed up or slow down accordingly. </p>
